    "## Scope\n",
    "- Predict the probability of user engagement with an AD given context (query, device, etc)\n",

    "## Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Offline\n",
    "- AUC (Area under curve)\n",
    "    - Common metric for binary classification.\n",
    "    - Does not penalize how far off predicted score is from the actual label.\n",
    "    - Insensitive to well-calibrated probabilities.\n",
    "- Log loss (Cross-entropy loss)\n",
    "    - Calibration sensitive metric.\n",
    "    - Captures what degree expected probabilities diverge from class label.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Online\n",
    "- Revenue, which is the sum of winning bid value.\n",
    "    - If bid is $1 and user clicks the AD, advertiser is charged $1.\n",
    "    - Advertiser is not charged unless users click the AD.\n",
    "- Counter metric\n",
    "    - Hide the AD.\n",
    "    - Never see the AD.\n",

    "- AD selection selects all ADs matching the targeting criteria and predict AD relevance score using simple model.\n",
    "- AD selection also ranks the ADs and sends top ADs to AD prediction.\n",
    "- AD prediction uses ML model to predict precisely calibrated score.\n",
    "- AD auction uses bid and predicted score to pick the top most relevant ADs shown to users. \n",
