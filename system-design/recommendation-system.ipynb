    "## Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "- Give a user and context (time, location, etc) predict probability of engagement for each movie, and order movies.\n",
    "- Will use implicit feedback (user watched the movie or not) rathen explicit feedback (user rated the movie) to gather large training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Online\n",
    "- Engagement rate: (user clicked a movie / total number of sessions)\n",
    "- Videos watched: count videos user watch at least for some time.\n",
    "- Session watch time: overall time that user spent watching movies based on recommendation in a session.\n",

    "    - $P(k)$ = precision up to $k$\n",
    "    - Precision = number of relevant recommendations / total number of recommendations\n",
    "    - rel(k) = whether $k^{th}$ item is relevant or not\n",

    "    - m = number of movies relevant to user based on historical data\n",
    "    - Measures how system performs overall.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mean Average Recall (mAR @ N)\n",
    "    - Recall = number of relevant recommendations / number of all movies\n",
