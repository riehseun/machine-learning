    "- big data -> better models -> higher precision\n",

    "Process of using data streams\n",
    "- integration -> personalization -> precision\n",
    "\n",
    "Three types of data sources\n",
    "- machine, people, organization\n",
    "- people data is hard to process because velocity of data is fast and they tend to be very unstructured\n",
    "\n",
    "Data silos\n",
    "- data spread out between departments within an organization\n",
    "- bad because they are unsynchronized and invisible data\n",
    "\n",
    "Characteristics of big data\n",
    "- volumn: sheer size of data\n",
    "- variety: complexity. structural (ex. formats) / media (ex. how data is delivered) / semantic (ex. units) / availability (ex. real-time)\n",
    "- velocity: speed at creating/storing/analyzing data\n",
    "- veracity: quality\n",
    "- valence: connectedness\n",

    "HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)\n",
    "- scalability / reliability\n",
    "- spread files to differnt nodes for parallel access\n",
    "- partitioning and replication for fault tolerance (node failure doesn't cause files to become unaccessible)\n",
    "- NameNode for metadata (1 node per cluster), DataNode for block storage (each node per cluster)\n",

    "- resource manager for Hadoop\n",
    "- while node manager is in charge of each machine, resource manager decides who gets what\n",
    "- allows applications to run on the same Hadoop cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "MapReduce\n",
    "- programming model for Hadoop ecosystem\n",
    "- relies on YARN\n",
    "- not good for frequently changing data\n",
    "- consists of mapping, shuffling, and reducing\n",
    "- delegates large tasks to lots of nodes and aggregates the result\n",
