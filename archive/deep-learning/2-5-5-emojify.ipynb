This is what allows vectorization to work: If you had a 3-word sentence and a 4-word sentence, then the computations needed for them are different (one takes 3 steps of an LSTM, one takes 4 steps) so it's just not possible to do them both at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The common solution to this is to use padding. Specifically, set a maximum sequence length, and pad all sequences to the same length. For example, of the maximum sequence length is 20, we could pad every sentence with \"0\"s so that each input sentence is of length 20. Thus, a sentence \"i love you\" would be represented as $(e_{i}, e_{love}, e_{you}, \\vec{0}, \\vec{0}, \\ldots, \\vec{0})$. In this example, any sentences longer than 20 words would have to be truncated. One simple way to choose the maximum sequence length is to just pick the length of the longest sentence in the training set. "
