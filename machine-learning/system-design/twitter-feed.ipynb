    "    \n",
    "## Online experimentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use training and validation data to train 15 different models.\n",
    "- Use test data to select the best model offline.\n",
    "- Do A/B testing between the best offline model and online model.\n",
    "    - Before testing, retraining the best offline model with the latest data.\n",
    "    - Select 1% of users. Use existing model to half of 1% of users. Use the best offline model to the other half of 1% of users.\n",
    "    - Compare user engagement.\n",
    "        - Use statistical significance. (Ex. p-value)\n",
    "        - Also, consider if new model causes the system to be more complex."
