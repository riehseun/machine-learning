    "- Fit training set well on cost function. (bigger network, better optimization algorithm)\n",
    "- Then, fit dev set well on cost function. (regularization, bigger training set)\n",

    "\n",
    "- Choose a dev set and test set to reflect data you expect to get in the future and consider important to do well on.\n",

    "- If doing well on your metric and dev/test set does not correcpond to doing well on your application, change your metric and/or dev/test set.\n",

    "- Must not be used in time-series data.\n",
    "- $k$ in practice should be $4-5$."
